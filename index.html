        <h1>Thanx for visit</h1>
            <p>Hello! I am a dedicated and versatile professional with a dual passion for technology and sports. As a Salesforce Developer, I have successfully created two projects in Salesforce and one front-end project, showcasing my ability to build robust and user-friendly applications.

This blend of technical proficiency and athletic discipline defines my unique skill set, allowing me to bring a dynamic and driven approach to every endeavor. Whether it's developing innovative solutions in Salesforce or representing my state in volleyball, I am committed to excellence and continuous improvement. I look forward to leveraging my skills and experiences to contribute to impactful projects and teams.</p>
