            <p>Hello! I am a dedicated and versatile professional with a dual passion for technology and sports. As a Salesforce Developer, I have successfully created two projects in Salesforce and one front-end project, showcasing my ability to build robust and user-friendly applications. My technical expertise is complemented by my athletic achievements; I am a national-level volleyball player, having competed in four national championships across various states in India, spanning from north to south and east to west. This blend of technical proficiency and athletic discipline defines my unique skill set, allowing me to bring a dynamic and driven approach to every endeavor. Whether it's developing innovative solutions in Salesforce or representing my state in volleyball, I am committed to excellence and continuous improvement. I look forward to leveraging my skills and experiences to contribute to impactful projects and teams.</p>
